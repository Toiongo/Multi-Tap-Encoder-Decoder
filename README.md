# Multi-Tap Encoder/Decoder
Keyboard phones multi-tap encoding/decoding.

Old phones used to have layout where you'd need to press a button multiple times to get your letter or symbol.
It looked something like this:

This can be used as a cypher of sorts, so i've made a program that allows you to encode strings in such a manner.
An example, the result for encoding "Hello" would be: 4433555555666.
Hopefully, you get the gist of it.
